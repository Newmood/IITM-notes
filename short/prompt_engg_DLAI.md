Two types of LLMs:
- **Base LLM** : Predicts next word based on the large amount general of data available. Hence, often fails at providing desired outputs.
- **Instruction tuned LLM** : Further training and fine tuning on base LLM and often developed using RLHF, hence they are instruction tuned and produced way better outputs.
