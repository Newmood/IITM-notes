# Week 1
- Good decisions are based on an accurate understanding of good data.
- Data viz makes cognitive processing easier
- Descibe, explore and summarize


Four umbrella principles of effective visualization:
1. Know purpose : A purpose statement for every table or graph displayed. (not necessarily a message, a message may be conveyed by series of charts.)
2. Ensure integrity : Don't use misleading scales and distort the truth.
3. Maximize data ink; minimize non-data ink
4. Show your data; annotate : Annotations can also quickly get messy, be judicious.

### Executing infromation display is three step process - 
- **Defining a message:** What am I trying to communicate? How do I make it clear?
- **Choosing Form:** Text, table, graph or a chart? (If its required to enter text, do so.)
- **Creating Design:** What design principles lead to quick cognitive processing and effectively conveying message.


| Table | Chart |  
|-------|-------|
| Display a complete data set |  Compare a slice of information |
| Focus on specific item in context of complete data | Show "cause of change" vs "effect" |
| Present wide range of data that is difficult to scale using graph | Show change over time |
| Explain how results are derived (calclations) | Show patterns of distribution (normal/gaussian) |

Basic forms for messages:
1. Pie chart : Large dominance of one item over others, components of one item adding upto to 100.
2. Column / Stacked column : Components of multiple items
3. Bar chart : Item comparison
4. Line chart : Change over time
5. Histogram : Frequency, distritbution
6. Scatter, Paired bar : Correlation

Notes:
1. Make it easier for eyes, use annotations but be judicious, dont clutter
2. Mind, anecdotal evidence might just be outliers. 
3. Avoid 3D, almost useless and deceitful.

### Dashboard
_A visual display_ of the _most important information needed to achieve one or more objectives_ that has been _consolidate on a single screen_ so it can be _monitored and understood at a glance._

1. Interactive : Interactive dashboards just increase the complexity of it. Dashboard is supposed to give entire idea about one objective at one glance.
2. Real time : Not a dashboard, "real time monitoring" by itself.
3. Do not clutter with additional info if objectives are fulfilled. Link to supporting details and direct to another page.
