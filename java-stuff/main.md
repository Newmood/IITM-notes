# Java self-learn notes

Book : [A Concise and Practical Introduction to Prgramming Algorithms in Java by Frank Nielsen](https://www.amazon.in/Practical-Introduction-Programming-Algorithms-Undergraduate/dp/184882338X)

## Chapter 1

- File name and `class` name should be same
- Workflow
    - Type/Edit program
    - Compile: `javac program.java`
    - Run/Execute: `java program`

> Section 1.2.2: HelloWorld program  
    terminal: javac HelloWorld  
    error: error: Class names, 'HelloWorld', are only accepted if annotation processing is explicitly requested
    
    The fix is to just run with the `.java` at end.
